# 512_Course_Project
# Covid Case Analysis

The course project is broken into four parts: 

Part 1 - Common Analysis sets the stage for the subsequent assignments. In A4 you conduct a base analysis. All of the students in the class will conduct the same analysis, but with a slightly different data subset.

Part 2 - Extension Plan will require you to ask a human centered data science question that extends the work in A4: Common Analysis.

Part 3 - Presentation will require you to give a modified (shorter) PechaKucha presentation of your completed project.

Part 4 - Project Repository, creation of a fully documented repository and also requires the submission of a written project report.
